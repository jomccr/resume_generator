# Resume Generator

Write your resume in a quick, concise YAML format, and see it 
built into a beautiful, professional resume. 

This project is built with Python 3.7 using Flask. See the `requirements.txt`
file for the full list of packages to install. 

## Running the app

If you have docker installed, you can build and run the app by cloning the repo and running 
```
docker-compose up 
```

The docker image is using `python:3.7-alpine` so the entire container should be less than 100MB.
